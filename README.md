# WebAgency

## Integration of a model for a web agency

This is the first project of my [OpenClassrooms web developer training](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/48-developpeur-web-junior) where I had to integrate a model to create a showcase website for a fictitious web agency called WebAgency.

For making this project, I had to use only **HTML/CSS**. CSS preprocessors, frameworks, JavaScript or any programming language were not allowed.

I used the BEM methodology in order to keep my CSS code as future proof and clean as possible. I also used the 7-1 pattern to organize my CSS files.
